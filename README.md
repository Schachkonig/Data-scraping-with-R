Data scraping, advanced visualizations and other things with R

I took data from web, prepared it and used it for different kinds of visualization like Chord diagram, Network diagram and Dendrogram. The data described 20 most cited science works and their authors, visualizations, in their turn, showed different prospectives of connections between authors.
The point was to demonstrate scrapping data and building awesome non-interactive and interactive diagrams in R.
